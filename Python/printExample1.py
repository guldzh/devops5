print('Hello world')

# In python there is no differnece between using single or double quotes

print("Hello world") 

# In python any text should be placed in the double or single quotes.
# print(Hello world) -> this code will generate a syntax error because we are missing quotes.

# Python is the case sensitive programming language. 

# triple quotation in python -> '''  """ -> displaying multiline text for print

print("""Hi everyone,
      My meeting were all late today.
      Thank you""")
