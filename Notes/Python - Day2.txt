A variable in programming is like a container where we can store the data. 

There are 3 main reasons why we use variables:
- Storage -> variables allow us to store data that we use and modify later.
- Readibility -> makes our code easier to understand and debug and find what the data 
                 represents
- Reusibility -> once the value is stored in a variable, you can use that variables 
                 multiple times in different parts of your code

Formula of the Variable creation:
 variablename = value

Naming a variable rules:
      - variable name cannot start with the number
      - it can not have space in between words
      - it can only contain alphanumeric chars and underscore 
      - variable names are case sensitive

Naming Conventions:
    - convention is how do you name thevariables. 
    - Therwe are 4 different types of nameing conventuons:
       1. CamelCase - firstName
       2. Pascal Case - FirstName
       3. Snake Case - first_name (most of python users uses this naming)
       4. Kebab Case - first-name 

NOTE: when creating the variable, type of variable is auto unerstood by python.

Type of Nmerical Variables:
        1. Integers - represents whole numbers. Ex: age = 25
        2. Float - represents real numbers. (numbers with decimal points)
        3. Complex - represent complex numbers that has both imaginary and real parts. 
           Ex: 5+4j-> 5 is the real part and the 4j is the imaginary part


Type Function -> is a built in python function used to determine the data type of variable.
It helps debugging. Useful when learning, it helps to understand how python works with datatypes
Ex: a=10
    print(type(a)) # Output <class 'int'>
    a=10.1
    print(type(a)) # Output <class 'float'>

Creating multiple variables in Single Line: 
We can define multiple variables on ansingle line, by seperating them with commas.
Syntax: a,b,c =1.1, 1, "h" 

Assinging multiple Variables with a same value
Ex: a=b=c=d=5 -> all variables here will be assigned 
                 with a value 5 and a type for all variables will be int

Reassignment in python
    After variables assigned with the value, we can assign a new value to them
    Ex: var1=6
        var1=10
